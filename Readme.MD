Geo-Congress
------------

Learning node.js via common work tasks.

This script takes a CSV with identifier and address columns, geocode and append congressional district, bioguide (unique) id for matching members of Congress, output as a new CSV.

I recommend using the Data Science Toolkit on your local network for high volume geocoding.
